# FutureMakers2022

Reflections:

6/6: Today, I learned about the basic operations of python as well as basic methods for pandas and numpy. Overall, this was mostly a review, but it helped to warm up my coding skills in order to prepare for what we learn next.

6/7: The most interesting thing from today was working with the GraphViz library, which helped me visualize the decision tree and random forest models on the iris dataset. It was very interesting to see the actual "decisions" the computer made in order to arrive at its final classification. It was also interesting hearing about semisupervised and reinforcement learning.

6/8: Today I learned about the basics of deep learning using Tensorflow. Fortunately, I already have experience using tensorflow, but it was a good review nonetheless. I particularly liked how we compared all of the different kinds of models, and well as different model architectures, in order to better understand it.
